# Implementation Plan: Initialize Boilerplate Hello World

**Branch**: `001-initialize-boilerplate-hello` | **Date**: 2025-10-06 | **Spec**: /Users/adam/IdeaProjects/zte-mc888-ultra-deamon/specs/001-initialize-boilerplate-hello/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from /Users/adam/IdeaProjects/zte-mc888-ultra-deamon/specs/001-initialize-boilerplate-hello/spec.md

## Summary
Deliver a mocked end-to-end hello-world experience for the ZTE MC888 Ultra daemon that showcases `zte run` and `zte read <metric>` CLI flows, produces structured logging, and demonstrates modem telemetry + MQTT messaging patterns without requiring live hardware. The approach leans on uv-managed Python 3.12, gmqtt mocks, and Click-based command scaffolding so developers can validate toolchain wiring, experiment with recorded modem responses, and extend toward real integrations.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.12 (uv stable channel)
**Primary Dependencies**: uv runtime, gmqtt (mocked client usage), Click CLI, standard logging
**Storage**: N/A (in-memory telemetry snapshots; fixtures on disk only for tests)
**Testing**: pytest, pytest-asyncio, anyio-driven async helpers
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS developer workstations running mocked modem & MQTT flows
**Project Type**: single-service CLI/daemon under `/Users/adam/IdeaProjects/zte-mc888-ultra-deamon/src`
**Performance Goals**: Deterministic hello-world CLI execution with sub-second startup and reproducible log ordering
**Constraints**: Local-network-only modem addressing, offline-friendly MQTT mocking, auto-bootstrap of tooling before CLI runs
**Scale/Scope**: Single developer workflows validating modem telemetry + MQTT pipelines with extensibility toward full attribute coverage

## Constitution Check
- **Telemetry completeness**: `data-model.md` enumerates CLI commands, telemetry snapshots, MQTT payloads, and logging entities, while `contracts/modem/mock-status.json` captures modem fields and documents the backlog for unsupported attributes via structured warnings.
- **Local network enforcement**: All CLI defaults (e.g., `--device-host`) and documentation keep endpoints on RFC 1918 space (`192.168.0.1`), explicitly rejecting public overrides without opt-in flags, maintaining the constitution’s local-only mandate.
- **Deterministic messaging**: MQTT placeholder contract at `/Users/adam/IdeaProjects/zte-mc888-ultra-deamon/specs/001-initialize-boilerplate-hello/contracts/mqtt/hello-world-message.json` fixes schema version `0.1.0-mock`, topics, and payload structure, clarifying future migration steps in documentation.
- **Documentation parity**: `quickstart.md` covers CLI usage, fixture capture workflow, MQTT placeholder context, logging outputs, and cleanup expectations; Markdown evidence trails remain synchronized with planned behavior.
- **Operational surface**: CLI design reserves diagnostics flags (foreground/background, log level/file) and quickstart instructions address Linux-friendly execution, aligning exit handling and logging with operability requirements.

**Structure Decision**: Single-project CLI/daemon housed under `/Users/adam/IdeaProjects/zte-mc888-ultra-deamon/src/zte_daemon`, with mirrored test suites under `/Users/adam/IdeaProjects/zte-mc888-ultra-deamon/tests` to maintain TDD cadence.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
- Resolved unknowns around uv-managed Python stability, gmqtt offline mocking, and human-captured modem fixtures; documented decisions in `research.md` with rationale and alternatives.
- Validated that no NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers remain in the feature spec and codified fixture capture workflow plus gmqtt mocking strategy to unblock development.
- Outcome: `/Users/adam/IdeaProjects/zte-mc888-ultra-deamon/specs/001-initialize-boilerplate-hello/research.md` enumerates the decisions guiding CLI defaults, mocking boundaries, and developer workflows.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- Extracted core entities (`CLICommand`, `ModemTelemetrySnapshot`, `MQTTPlaceholderMessage`, `LogEvent`) into `data-model.md`, capturing validation and relationships demanded by the constitution.
- Authored CLI, modem, and MQTT contracts under `/Users/adam/IdeaProjects/zte-mc888-ultra-deamon/specs/001-initialize-boilerplate-hello/contracts/`, including schema-failing fixture expectations to enforce TDD.
- Produced `quickstart.md` describing uv bootstrap, CLI usage, mocked telemetry handling, and test execution instructions.
- Agent context updated via `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex` on 2025-10-06 to keep global guidance synchronized with this feature.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
- `/tasks` will ingest plan + design artifacts to emit approximately 25–30 ordered tasks prioritizing TDD.
- Tasks will cover: generating CLI scaffolding (run/read commands), implementing mock modem + MQTT clients, wiring logging config, creating uv project metadata, and ensuring tests for CLI help, modem fixture validation, and MQTT payloads run before implementation.
- Ordering: fixtures and data models precede CLI/service layers, with contract and integration tests queued ahead of implementation tasks; annotate parallelizable items (e.g., CLI command tests) with `[P]` for concurrent ownership.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
- Phase 3 (`/tasks`) will materialize `tasks.md`.
- Phase 4 executes generated tasks to build the hello-world CLI, abide by constitution, and keep documentation in lockstep.
- Phase 5 validates via `uv run pytest`, manual CLI smoke tests, and quickstart walkthrough using both sample and captured fixtures.
