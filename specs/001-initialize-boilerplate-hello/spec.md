# Feature Specification: Initialize Boilerplate Hello World

**Feature Branch**: `001-initialize-boilerplate-hello`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "initialize boilerplate hello world for this project. stack: Python stable, uv, gmqtt, standard logging, click. Test driven development with Modem api mocking. Human will provide responses based curl requests on real device"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: Which CLI command naming should the spec lock in for the hello-world experience? → A: Use `zte run` for the daemon and `zte read <metric>` for interactive reads.
- Q: For the canonical `zte run` hello-world invocation, which runtime environment should the spec treat as the default expectation? → A: Run entirely with mocked modem and MQTT; sample addresses are placeholders.
- Q: When the MQTT broker configuration is absent or unreachable during the hello-world flow, what should the system do? → A: Log a warning and continue with built-in mock broker defaults.
- Q: When mocked tests encounter missing or malformed human-captured modem responses, what should happen? → A: Fail the affected tests with a clear instructional error.
- Q: When a developer runs the hello-world CLI with an unsupported Python version or missing required tooling, what’s the expected behavior? → A: Build should be self-sufficient by auto-installing prerequisites before rerunning.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a daemon developer, I need a ready-to-run hello-world baseline that reflects the modem-oriented workflow so I can validate the toolchain, messaging expectations, and testing approach before adding complex features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh project checkout on a supported development environment, **When** the developer invokes the designated hello-world CLI entrypoint, **Then** the system must display a friendly modem-focused greeting, emit structured log output, and exit successfully.
2. **Given** the developer runs the default automated test suite, **When** tests execute against the mocked modem API and MQTT handshake flow, **Then** the suite must pass and demonstrate how human-provided device responses can be injected into future tests.

### Edge Cases
- If the MQTT broker configuration is absent or unreachable during the hello-world flow, the CLI logs a warning and continues with built-in mock broker defaults.
- If mocked tests encounter missing or malformed human-provided modem responses, they fail with a clear instructional error explaining how to supply valid fixtures.
- If the developer runs the CLI with unsupported Python or missing required tooling, the build bootstraps the prerequisites automatically so the hello-world run remains self-sufficient.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST expose a clearly documented command-line entrypoint that showcases the daemon's hello-world interaction for developers and operators.
- **FR-002**: The hello-world execution MUST produce structured logs using the project's standard logging conventions so stakeholders can confirm observability wiring.
- **FR-003**: The baseline MUST simulate the modem MQTT greeting flow using mocked endpoints so the hello-world run succeeds without live broker connectivity while retaining graceful handling instructions for future real integration.
- **FR-004**: The boilerplate MUST include an automated test suite that demonstrates test-driven development patterns for modem interactions via a mocked API surface, failing fast with clear instructional errors when human-provided fixtures are missing or malformed.
- **FR-005**: The solution MUST illustrate how human-captured modem responses (e.g., via curl against a real device) can be incorporated into tests without blocking automated runs.
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST guide developers through installing prerequisites, running the hello-world CLI, executing tests, and understanding how the mock modem components map to real hardware expectations.
- **FR-007**: The CLI MUST standardize on `zte run` for daemon execution and `zte read <metric>` for interactive queries, aligning documentation, help output, and tests with this command structure.
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST state that the provided MQTT host, topic, and credentials are illustrative placeholders because the hello-world run relies on mocked messaging rather than a live broker.
- **FR-009**: The setup MUST auto-bootstrap required Python tooling so the hello-world CLI run is self-sufficient even on machines missing dependencies.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Developer Session**: Represents the person running the hello-world CLI, needing guidance on environment setup, logging expectations, and next steps.
- **Mock Modem API**: Simulated interface mirroring the real modem's HTTP responses so tests can evolve without live hardware.
- **MQTT Exchange Context**: Captures the broker endpoint assumptions, topics, and payload stubs used to illustrate the daemon's messaging responsibilities.
