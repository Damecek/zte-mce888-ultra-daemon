# Feature Specification: Initialize Boilerplate Hello World

**Feature Branch**: `001-initialize-boilerplate-hello`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "initialize boilerplate hello world for this project. stack: Python stable, uv, gmqtt, standard logging, click. Test driven development with Modem api mocking. Human will provide responses based curl requests on real device"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a daemon developer, I need a ready-to-run hello-world baseline that reflects the modem-oriented workflow so I can validate the toolchain, messaging expectations, and testing approach before adding complex features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh project checkout on a supported development environment, **When** the developer invokes the designated hello-world CLI entrypoint, **Then** the system must display a friendly modem-focused greeting, emit structured log output, and exit successfully.
2. **Given** the developer runs the default automated test suite, **When** tests execute against the mocked modem API and MQTT handshake flow, **Then** the suite must pass and demonstrate how human-provided device responses can be injected into future tests.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the MQTT broker configuration is absent or unreachable during the hello-world flow?
- How does the system handle missing or malformed human-provided modem responses while still keeping the test suite reliable?
- What feedback is provided if the developer executes the CLI from an unsupported Python version or without required tooling?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST expose a clearly documented command-line entrypoint that showcases the daemon's hello-world interaction for developers and operators.
- **FR-002**: The hello-world execution MUST produce structured logs using the project's standard logging conventions so stakeholders can confirm observability wiring.
- **FR-003**: The baseline MUST attempt an MQTT greeting flow aligned with future modem messaging, including graceful handling when no broker is reachable.
- **FR-004**: The boilerplate MUST include an automated test suite that demonstrates test-driven development patterns for modem interactions via a mocked API surface.
- **FR-005**: The solution MUST illustrate how human-captured modem responses (e.g., via curl against a real device) can be incorporated into tests without blocking automated runs.
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST guide developers through installing prerequisites, running the hello-world CLI, executing tests, and understanding how the mock modem components map to real hardware expectations.
- **FR-007**: The team MUST confirm alignment on the expected CLI command name and invocation pattern [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: preferred command naming convention not provided].
- **FR-008**: The team MUST clarify whether the initial hello-world MQTT handshake should use a live broker, a stub broker, or remain purely illustrative [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target broker environment unspecified].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Developer Session**: Represents the person running the hello-world CLI, needing guidance on environment setup, logging expectations, and next steps.
- **Mock Modem API**: Simulated interface mirroring the real modem's HTTP responses so tests can evolve without live hardware.
- **MQTT Exchange Context**: Captures the broker endpoint assumptions, topics, and payload stubs used to illustrate the daemon's messaging responsibilities.
